Attributes can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to change its default behavior or provide additional data about it.

Attributes consist of a name and a value in the format `name="value"`:

```pseudo
<tag name="value"></tag>
```

HTML elements can have any number of attributes.

The example below displays an image element with three attributes:

```html
<img src="nyan_cat.gif" width="500" height="600" />
```

These declare its source, width, and height.

**Note:** Attribute names are not case-sensitive, but it is good practice to write HTML markup in lowercase.
