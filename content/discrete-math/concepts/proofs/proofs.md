**Proofs** are a concept in discrete mathematics used to verify the truthfulness and validity of statements. They use logical reasoning to establish the certainty of mathematical claims, playing a crucial role in advancing the field of mathematics.

## Conjecture

Conjectures are used to construct a mathematical proof. They can be thought of as a building block of a hypothesis that can be validated using logic and patterns.

Mathematical exploration and discovery heavily depend on the implementation of conjecture.

## Base Case

Base case is term that is described as the initial or smallest value that verifies a statement to be correct. According to the Principle of Mathematical Induction, a proof is bifurcated into two steps:

- Base Case (_verification of base step_): The initial or smallest value is checked to establish the truth of the statement.
- Inductive Step (_inductive hypothesis and conclusion_): Assuming the statement holds for a given value, it is shown that it also holds for the next value, extending the validity of the statement.
